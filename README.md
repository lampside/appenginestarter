# App Engine Starter

A basic demonstration of Google App Engine. This is a starter code which you can use simply to serve
HTML templates and static files. This is part of the appengine GitHub series by [Lampside Web Design](http://www.lampsidewebdesign.com/),
and is used as the basic shell for other apps such as:

* App Engine Contact (coming soon)
* App Engine Blogger (coming soon)
* App Engine CMS (coming soon)
